##thought process:

Analyze problem. Use 2D array to tackle the problem.

Create variables and start working on the methods

1. check if player wants to go first
2. print board
3. check if move is valid
4. place move
5. Player turn
6. computer turn
7. check for win/draw
8. check if player wants to play again

Run the code and test for bugs
